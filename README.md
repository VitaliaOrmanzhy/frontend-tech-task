## How to set up the project

All scripts described below (except for _**dependency installation**_) can be used with pnpm instead of npm. They work the same way

### Installing dependencies

After downloading the project's source code, you need to install the dependencies. To do this, you can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm i
# or
pnpm install
```

### Run

To start the project for development, use the script `dev`:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This script automatically refreshes the page after you make changes in the code and works quickly with `vite`.

### Build

To compile the project, use the script `build`:

```shell
npm run build
```

After executing this script, you will have a folder `dist` in which the project's output files will be located, which can be uploaded to hosting.

Also, to see how the compiled version of the program looks, you can use the script `preview`.

```shell
npm run preview
```
